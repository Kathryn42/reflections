How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I don't need to compare other lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I mess up somewhere along the line, I can restore the old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: If I made a mistake, I can choose not to save it.
    only savelogical change
    cons: might forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    in Git, most files are related to each other, they are in the same repo.
    in Google Docs, most files are independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the history
    git diff compares a pair of versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can checkout older version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    my big project
